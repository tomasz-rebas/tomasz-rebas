## Hi there 👋 Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a Frontend Developer with 4 years of commercial experience, specializing in development of web applications in React, Next.js and TypeScript. I thrive in international teams following Agile methodologies. Lately, I've been exploring App Router, Node.js and modern state management tools like MobX and Redux Toolkit to broaden my skill set.

I encourage you to check out a wildlife photography portfolio I designed and implemented with Next.js v15, App Router and a headless CMS: ![Tomasz Rębas - wildlife photography](https://tomaszrebas.pl/)
